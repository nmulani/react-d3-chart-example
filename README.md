See `src/App.js` for initialization of React-D3 component and `src/ProgressArc.js` for definition of React-D3 arc component.

Built on top of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate, based on instructions from the [Building D3 Components with React](https://hackernoon.com/building-d3-components-with-react-7510e4743288#.c7mhgzle9) tutorial.
